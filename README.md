# ColorSense
ColorSense is a minimalistic implementation of a neural network using Brain.js to predict the most suitable text color (black or white) for a randomly generated background color. The project demonstrates how a simple feedforward neural network can be trained to make binary classifications based on RGB color inputs.

Key features include:

    Basic Neural Network Training: Utilizes Brain.js to train a neural network on RGB values and their corresponding ideal text colors.
    Interactive Prediction: Displays predictions in real-time as new background colors are generated.
    User Feedback Integration: Allows users to provide feedback to refine the training dataset and improve the network's accuracy.
    Data Visualization: Outputs the updated dataset in JSON format for further inspection or reuse.

This project serves as an educational example of how to use Brain.js for practical neural network implementations, emphasizing simplicity and the fundamental concepts of machine learning.
